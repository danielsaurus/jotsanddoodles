Reference
=====
template: reference

This is an ever evolving repository of reference materials used in my writing on [hackmake.org](http://hackmake.org) and general documentation of the ways I work. It consists mostly of list-based and outline-style notes. In some cases there will be change logs which note the ways that that particular system or note has changed so I can remember _why_ when I look back later.

I've found that life has been moving really quickly by me and I want to consistently be mindful of the ways I work and hope to use these reference materials as a tool to inspect and recall. It's basically my personal wiki.

You can access the raw markdown for each note with the link at the top of each page and the change log on GitHub at the bottom. The entirety of reference materials are accessible on [Github](https://github.com/nickwynja/hackmake-reference) and intended for download and collaboration. This reference section is inspired by Sean Korzdorfer's [Open Notebook](http://www.seankorzdorfer.com/open_notebook/) project.
