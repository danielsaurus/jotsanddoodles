Reference

template: reference

This is an ever evolving repository of reference materials used in my writing on [hackmake.org](http://hackmake.org). It generally consists of list-based  and outline-style notes. This section uses [`markdown.css`](https://github.com/mrcoles/markdown-css) to display the notes in a familiar way but you can also access the raw markdown for each note with the link above. The entirety of reference materials are accessible on [Github](https://github.com/nickwynja/hackmake-reference) and intended for download and collaboration.
