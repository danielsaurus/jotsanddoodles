My Philosophy on Gear {#philosophy}
==================

Gear should be trustworthy. As a tool, it needs to be able to get the job done whenever it needs to and not fail you. Great gear is worth the money.

Here are some other post written of the value of gear and tools:

Bags {#bags}
============

I'm a big fan of GORUCK. They make military-grade gear that looks like it's fit for the street.

## Main Bag ##

GORUCK GR1 with the GR1 Field Pocket. This bag goes with me pretty much everywhere. I've written a full [review of the GR1][gr1] and a review of some [essential accessories][gr-acc].

## Additional Bag ##

The GORUCK Kit Bag goes with me on some trips, like home for Christmas where I'm hauling presents back and forth. At first I thought it was going to be a bit big but I'm happy with the size of it. Because it's taller like original parachute bags rather than longer duffle bags, even if it's half full it better holds form and is easy to carry.
