## Books {#books}

These are books I've read which have had a major impact on the way I live and work (in no particular order):

* Walden - Henry David Thoreau
* Writing Down the Bones - Natalie Goldberg
* Getting Things Done - David Allen
* Man's Search for Meaning - Victor Frankl
* The War of Art - Stephen Pressfield

## Blogs {#blogs}

* [inoveryourhead.net](http://inoveryourhead.net/) - One of the first blogs I followed that really pushed me towards something greater and wasn't just tech or news updates. Julien hasn't been posting as often in recent years because he's been practicing what he writes about--going out and doing great work. There's a great back catalogue so go check out his Best Of and get ready to get your ass kicked. Some of my recent favorite posts of his:

	* [The Complete Guide to Not Giving a Fuck](http://inoveryourhead.net/the-complete-guide-to-not-giving-a-fuck/)
	* [The Short and Sweet Guide to Being Fucking Awesome](http://inoveryourhead.net/the-short-and-sweet-guide-to-being-fucking-awesome/)
	* [Stop Being a Fucking Pussy](http://inoveryourhead.net/maybe-you-should-just-stop-being-a-fucking-pussy/)
	* I don't only like his posts that have expletives in the title but those are the ones where Julien gets the angriest about us being soft and not trying hard enough to be great
