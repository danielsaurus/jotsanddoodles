## Quality Gear

* Life cycle of a great pair of jeans
* Wearing out my cycling shoes
* The "iterations" you can go through with quality gear, learning and understanding what you've got and how it can improve. With a shorter lifecycle you don't always have the time to learn or care to learn because it's a cheap purchase
* Finding things you love lets you stop searching. Ie; goruck

## Glacial Pace

  * much of the great earth changing events took a long time. Is your "hustling" sustainable enough for you to make lasting change?
  * Is "disruption" a factor of big bursts or slow, iterative change?

## Resilience Takes Practice

Stick-to-it-ivness isn't just something that's natural, it takes practice and determination.

## Investing times systems to abstract thinking

Sometimes going deep into systems development is distracting. By being too close to the metal you can lose perspective on why you're doing this. I lost five days on deep development of Brain but in that have relieved an enormous amount of cognitive load by not having to worry about computing and backups and technology. Code abstracts functionality and eases use. Systems are meant to be self sustainable with only a little ongoing attention but to build simple solutions can be complex and require time upfront to abstract the computing down the road.

* The Benefits Of:
    * Always having a pen and notebook on you
    * Having a stash of cash

## Setting up personal scaffolding

Set Course Based on Concepts Not Criteria. Shaping that end goal as concepts not criteria will allow your course to lead to things that are much bigger than you can imagine.

## Ideas Can't Wait

Maybe I'll be lucky enough to have written a sentence or spill an idea that can change somebody. Maybe something I wrote could have just what someone needed to start their project, quit something they hate, or push with just a little more effort. It would be selfish to withhold that idea because I'm _scared_ to publish something. Things happen quickly, we don't have time to wait around and fret. We need ideas and encouragement. We need the people who have taken it upon themselves to lead to keep doing it. To not wait. You're thing might not be perfect but your imperfect words may be just what someone needed to hear to create something.

## The Way It's Done

Like your coffee or a good whiskey, it's not just about the source materials and more about the way it's done.

## Working on a Need to Know Basis

Only dealing with the information you need to know, forgetting about the rest

## The War Inside

>Conquer the war inside of yourself so you can conquer the war outside.

Figuring out our own problems so we can start helping others with theirs.

=====

* Offensive and Defensive Brain Dumps/Captures
* What's in your hands, house, and head shapes your environment
* Innovation doesn't come from new ideas, it comes from connecting the ideas of others
* Distinguishing sucking and failing
  * Failing is an end-point, sucking is continuous.
* Finding things you love lets you stop searching. Ie; goruck
* How a generation whose grown up with GTD functions compared to the current working crew.
* Minimizing errors
  * small things like 24 hour clock
