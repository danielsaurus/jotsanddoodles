Financial System
==============
template: reference

A good starting point to read about my set up: [My Financial Framework and System](http://hackmake.org/2012/10/my-financial-framework-and-system)

### Four main accounts: ###

  * Savings
  * Needs
  * Emergency
  * Wants

My paycheck gets divided and put into these accounts automatically. I use the [balanced money formula](http://www.getrichslowly.org/blog/2008/10/27/the-balanced-money-formula/) to determine the appropriate values for each Savings, Needs, and Wants accounts and their respective budgetary limits. The framework suggests keeping your "needs" expenses (groceries, rent/mortgage, etc.) under 50% of your net income, 30% for wants, and save 20%.

I've been able to save 45%, maintain my needs at around 35% of my income, and use 20% for wants.

### Tracking everything using [Mint](http://mint.com): ###

  * See trends by category
  * Tag transactions
  * Decent iOS apps

### Credit cards: ###
  
  * Took me a while to build credit in the States since moving here a few years ago
  * Wanted to get good at spending the real money I had rather than make-believe credit
  * Once I got comfortable there, started using cards exclusively to take advantage of points

I wanted to make sure that my credit card payments were taken from the right buckets from above so here's how I make sure I do that:

  1. Buy stuff using credit card
  1. In Mint, tag item like `need`
  1. Buy other "needs" stuff and tag it needs
  1. When I want to make payments, I go to the `need` tag and Mint shows me the total for those items tagged
  1. I make that payment
  1. I untag `need` and tag it `need_paid`

I also do this with items I've saved up for from my savings account. Once I make payments from needs or savings, I pay off the balance from my "wants" account because that's what the rest of those transactions are.
