Notes Workflow

## Naming Conventions ##

	Note Title -- tagx anotherx againx -- 2013-01-26 14:35:23

Date is optional. I went with the title first (many people use Merlin's `tags` system and put them first) because I do so much notes stuff on iPhone and iPad and often names are truncated, only showing you the tag when the title is the post important part for display purposes. Tags are important for search mostly.

## Scripts ##

A Hazel script runs once a week and gets files that match the `Scratchpad_YY-MM-DD` convention and move them into a `/Scratchpads/YYYY/MM_Month/` directory to help clean the root folder clean. Scratchpads are only really relevant for the week anyway and then get archived.

## Types of Things I Capture ##

* Info about people go into a note like `Their Name -- peoplex` which often contains:
	* Where/when we met
	* What they do
	* Conversations I want to have with them/ideas to share next time we meet
	* Contact information (if it's not someone I think I'll be contacting in the near term or it goes into Contacts.app)
* List of things like movies to watch and books to read titled something like `Books to Read -- listx`
